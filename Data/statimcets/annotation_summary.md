# Summary of Manual Changes Made to St̓át̓imcets Dataset
### Formatting Changes
- Removed content that does not belong in a given line, for example English comments included in the gloss line (x3).
- Fixed alterations that were accidentally made in the conversion of the PDF to .txt (e.g. misordered gloss due to a line break) (x3 not including the below).
    - Fixed pairs of examples where some element of the first example accidentally ended up on the second example (x8 pairs or triplets).
    - Fixed individual examples where some components ended up on the wrong line (e.g. half the gloss was in the translation line) (x2).
- Fixed spacing (e.g. removed a space between morpheme boundaries) (x1)

### Content Changes
- Made changes to the segmentation and/or gloss that a) fixed misalignments and b) were based on well-established patterns elsewhere in the data (x10).  If there were not enough other examples to be confident in the change, such examples were removed altogether (x10).
- For place names that had a literal gloss and the English name in brackets, only the English name was kept (e.g. gloss of tsal'álh as lake[Shalalth] was replaced with just Shalalth).  This was done because, for consistency, there can really only be one gloss per morpheme, and we decided the non-literal translation was more informative here (especially for being able to translate) (x30).

### Punctuation Changes
- Removed single quotes (used for quote within a quote) (x1).
- Added missing reduplication boundary (·) (can be confident in this as reduplication is very straightforwardly glossed with RED) (x1)
- Parentheses
    - Removed entire morphemes that appeared in the segmentation line but NOT the source line. Perhaps they are underlyingly there, but are not phonologically realized in the spoken sentence (x33).
        - In some cases, only the segmentation line was modified in this way (x11).
        - In others, both the segmentation AND gloss lines had an item removed, because this morpheme was also given a gloss (x20).
        - Finally, there were a couple of cases where only part of the morpheme was in parentheses, but the whole thing nonetheless was missing from the source line.  Thus removals were made to the segmentation and gloss lines (x2).
- Brackets
    -  Same as parentheses: removed entire morphemes that appeared in the segmentation line but NOT the source line. Perhaps they are underlyingly there, but are not phonologically realized in the spoken sentence (x38).
        - In some cases, only the segmentation line was modified in this way (x20).
        - In others, both the segmentation AND gloss lines had an item removed, because this morpheme was also given a gloss (x18).
